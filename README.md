# PythonWS_template

A template/example using Python3 to connect/stream market data/updates from [Phemex](https://phemex.com/user-guides/api-overview).

Disclaimer: Use at your own risk.

Instructions:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a new virtual environment, or use an existing virtual environment.
3. To get this working with your own Phemex API key ID and secret key, you'll need to create a .env file in the same repository/directory of the project.
4. Your key ID variable should be named key_id and your secret key variable should be named secret_key, in your .env file.
5. Finally, create a new project (if using an IDE) and use the repository as the root directory of the project, and hit build/run.

NOTE: This was built and tested with PyCharm on Windows10.
